# V-BLAST Algorithm Matlab Implementation
## Code Overview
The code represent an implementation in Matlab of the V-BLAST Algorithm for a MIMO System

Firstly, a 2x2 MIMO System has been made using Zero Forcing equalization with 16-QAM modulation in order to have a reference to see the improvement in performances.
Therefore, the V-BLAST algorithm has been implemented in the same 2x2 configuration.

In order to see the performances of the algorithm a 8x8, 16x16, 64x64 and 128x128 MIMO Systems has been tested.
